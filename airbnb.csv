It's only a 1/2-block walk to me from there; once a parking spot opens up on my street, you can then just move your car. The shopping center lot has patrolmen so your car will be very safe.  SECURITY Upon your arrival, please scroll through the courtyard's security box for my surname to gain access; this process will then be repeated for my building. Should either security box be out of order, I am available by cell phone.  KEYS You will be provided with your own key to access the apartment. Lost keys replacement charge: $50.

I'm not far from Northwestern and Loyola universities, and it takes about 15 minutes by car to get to the heart of the city (typically $4-$8 uber pool).","There is public transportation to the center of Chicago which is fairly easy as there is a bus at the end of my street, a block and three buildings away that takes one to the Red Line which is direct. With that said, I now only take Uber pool or Lyft Line and depending on the time of the day, I can get downtown for as little as $3.75 or say about $5+. It usually takes about 20-25 minutes, sometimes less. Last night at 7 pm, on St. Patrick's Day, I was in center of city and wanted Uber to get home and incredibly, they asked for $17.00! I had never seen that kind of pricing, so I waited and tried again 40 minutes later and got home for $5.50! Worth the wait,I should say! I tell all of my friends about Uber pool and those that were taking public transportation now prefer door-to-door at unbeatable prices and time-saving.","After having spent 24 years in Paris, my apartment definitely has a bit of a French flair !

I was born in Chicago and grew up in Wrigleyville on the Northside of Chicago which is a vibrant and diversified neighborhood.  I have a wonderful husband and an incredible daughter and have lived in our home for almost three decades.
For 15 years, I was honored to teach students Interior Design and Architecture at a Design College in Chicago.  I love to travel to other countries and experience their culture, language and foods.  My favorite cities so far, Amsterdam, Paris, Mexico City and Antwerp.  I hope to continue travels to far-off distant lands.  I used Airbnb for my second trip to Paris, and really preferred it to staying in a hotel.  And the primary reason for hosting on Airbnb is to offer guests the ability to experience Chicago and its unique neighborhoods in a home setting.  I enjoy meeting people from different states, countries and from diverse cultures.
My favorite foods are enjoyed in the company of my family and dear friends: Roasted Chicken, Margherita style thin-crust Pizza, Grilled vegetables, a nicely poached or grilled Fish, Thai, Vietnamese and Italian food.
My favorite books: â€œTo Kill a Mockingbirdâ€, â€œMusic for Chameleonsâ€ and the â€œHarry Potterâ€ series.  My favorite music: Bachâ€™s â€œConcerto for Two Violins in D minorâ€, Debussyâ€™s â€œClaire de Luneâ€, Pucciniâ€™s â€œNessun Dormaâ€, Kern & Fieldâ€™s â€œThe Way You Look Tonightâ€, Pink Floydâ€™s â€œAnother Brick in the Wallâ€, â€œHey Youâ€ and â€œMoneyâ€, Beatlesâ€™ â€œHey Judeâ€, Marc Anthonyâ€™s â€œEl Cantanteâ€, Adeleâ€™s â€œ21â€ album and Sam Smithâ€™s â€œIn the Lonely Hourâ€.

Other favorites have included Israel, Ecuador and Spain.  

I love cooking, dancing, chocolate, swimming and meeting new people.  I'm currently in graduate school and working full time so i'm often hitting the books or at the office.

These synonymous neighborhoods are famous for live music and nightlife, chef-driven restaurants and countless art galleries â€” many housed within the Flat Iron Arts Building. If you have an acute knowledge of craft cocktails or an affinity for coffee, plus want to sift through records or thrifted threads, there's no better area to sip and shop in the country. The area has become a prevailing influence on Chicago's Michelin-rated, James Beard Award-winning dining scene, boasting some of the city's most sought after tables. Wicker Park and Bucktown are also known for their palate pleasing nightcaps, like renowned brewery Piece and mixology tour de force The Violet Hour. Along North, Division, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues, you will find an unbelievable blend of vintage shops amid independently-owned boutiques touting fashions for both men and women, and luxury home goods and beauty products.",,,Guests will have private access to the unit and 1 parking spot.,I use and trust an off-site management team to help guests get the information and service they need to make their stay enjoyable!,"Very simply, please respect my home and my neighbors.

The community is now home to many of the city's firefighters, police officers, teachers, construction workers, labor union workers, engineers and other blue collar workers. Norwood Park is known especially for its abundance of green: lawns, parks, churchyards, and trees are its visual hallmarks. Every Memorial Day there is a parade that runs through Norwood Park. The parade has been a local tradition for more than 90 years, starting in 1922.

And for those who appreciate fine dining and drinks, the momentum behind the latest trendsetting openings continues to build and the late night energy swells. Dormant factories and industrial warehouses began their transformation in the 1970s and 1980s, becoming work spaces and studios for artists and entrepreneurs. What followed was an influx of new businesses that densely concentrated the area and have made River North a hub for creativity and entertainment. Anchoring the area is the massive Merchandise Mart, with its endless trade showrooms for furniture and design wholesalers, and surrounding this epicenter are eye-catching galleries, home stores and antique shops. And architectural standouts are plenty, from the twin corn cobs Marina City to its neighbor the stately, steel and glass 330 N.

I have always been interested in showing hospitality to others.  Before airbnb this was mostly done by inviting friends and others over to my home for dinner or cocktails....but I find it equally rewarding to be able to host a traveler and know that my home with influence their trip for the better.  

As I am getting older I have decided that I really want to travel and see more of the world...but limited finances (coupled with my refusal to sit int he back of planes) as well as a desire to really get to see how people live and just not how tourists are treated makes this a great option for me!  

I have quite a few different interests, but I am very into anything design related (architecture, shops, urban life) and am an avid collector of mid century furnishings and love modern art from around 1910 to 1960.  I am happy to have one black cat (I like cat's but one is just enough to keep it interesting) and love to entertain friends often.  I am also a sucker for British TV, and you will often find BBC America in the background.

I was lucky enough to have the New York Times recently devote two entire pages to me in their home section, making me sound much more interesting in print as compared with in reality and publishing some lovely pictures of my life.

In the summer of 2014 we added our daughter June to our family. Needless to say we love it here and are very excited to welcome guests from around the world into our new space.   

Courtney works as a wardrobe and prop stylist in film and commercial photography.   She has done a great job applying her craft in the design and layout of our space. 


We have been fortunate to have done quite a bit of traveling ourselves over the years (both in the U.S.and abroad).  We know that having great accommodations can be the difference between an amazing experience in a new place, or a total nightmare.  

It's our goal to provide our guests with a space that is clean, comfortable, safe, and conveniently located.  Because we are parents we have set up our space with families in mind.   The opportunity to provide travelers with the type of service and comfort we would hope for on a trip is something that is very exciting to us.

From George: ""I'm originally from Texas but have been living in Chicago for several years now. I majored in Economics and International Relations and I work in development for an international organization. I also enjoy volunteering with arts charity organizations around the city.

""I speak Spanish and French. I love to travel and and was lucky to be an exchange student to Switzerland through Rotary International and to study abroad in France when I was in college. I love business, politics, art, and cooking simple but delicious paleo meals.""

From Sean: ""I've spent most of my life in the Chicagoland area. I was born in Downers Grove and grew up in Plainfield. I became enamored with Chicago a few years back and knew I wanted to live here. A few things I enjoy very much are cooking home-made meals for my friends, Chicago blues, and photography. My first job in high school was as the photographer for a paintball field in Joliet. I probably still have a few bruises somewhere to prove it!

We are here to answer all of your questions about Chicago, whether you need a restaurant recommendation, public transit tips, or insider tips on how to experience the Chicago that locals know and love. 

We love this city, especially getting ribs at Twin Anchors in Old Town before a show at Second City. Wicker Park is a frequent hangout, where we tend to be pulled to the patio at Big Star, the bar at XOCO, and cocktails at Violet Hour. 

And free concerts at Pritzker Pavilion in Millenium Park can't be matched by any city in the world. 

We'd love to help you experience all of this with us and so much more!",78%,f,Old Town,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,"Old Town, Chicago, IL 60614, United States",Lincoln Park,41.91343219,-87.63630258,t,Entire home/apt,8,2,3,4,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace""}",350,6500,300,150,4,25,365,1 week ago,0,30,60,302,10,9,10,f,strict,0.39,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,0

We now split our time between Chicago and Iowa City where my family lives. I was formerly the Operations Manager for the Barbara Lynch Gruppo, an independent restaurant group in Boston and  a company I worked with for 8 years. 

My involvement with Airbnb has grown organically, beginning in Boston after I left my job and posted my place in order in order to take advantage of my career gap and do some traveling. Ultimately I decided to move us to Chicago to be closer to family, and I started renting our Chicago apartment during our trips to Iowa City. These trips grew more and more frequent as both of my parents' health rapidly declined. Airbnb turned out to be a unique way to stay unemployed during this difficult family time, and I now have four properties listed. My mom passed away just this past September and I'm incredibly grateful that Airbnb has provided me with a way to spend as much time with my family as possible this past year. It has truly been a gift.
 
This fall I began the MBA program at the University of Iowa, and am loving being in school again. I'm also enjoying a return to my hometown (something I never thought I would voluntarily do) and being able to spend time with my Dad. 

It's been an unusual journey and none of it would have been possible without Airbnb. I am a huge proponent of Airbnb and the sharing communities and an absolute acolyte.

Having spent more time than I care to remember in sterile, uninviting hotel rooms, I was initially attracted to vacation rentals as refreshing, and often more affordable, alternatives.  What I found were the same white walls and beige furniture or, even worse, cluttered rooms and Aunt Edna's donated dilapidated couch in the living room.  Well, welcome to something different.  Take a break from your busy schedule by relaxing in clean, inviting rental that that feels enough like home that you're immediately comfortable while being so special you'll look forward to your return.  Many of my guests have been back 2 or 3 times, and some have found themselves venturing across the country to check out another Red Hot Vacation Rental.

A few facts about myself:
 - Love to cook
 - Very into fashion
 - I am a wine and whiskey gal, bourbon to be exact. I am more of a red wine drinker, but I recently just discovered a love for New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and can't get enough. It has been my summer wine along with Prosecco, which never lets me down.
 - Because I am a foodie, I love having dinner parties and cooking for my friends and family. I also love trying out new restaurants and bars.
 - I am the kind of person that will try almost anything once, so bring on the new and challenging experiences.
 - I love to binge watch shows and movies on most streaming devices. A few of my favorite shows are Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, etc... The list can go on and on. Also LOVE Korean dramas, especially the period pieces.
 - I am a lover of Art and History (I get the history part from my Dad)

I believe travel is the best form of education, there is nothing like immersing oneself in a new culture. You learn a lot about yourself and others when you do this and get to experience so many amazing things and people. The more I travel the more I learn that we are all the same on this planet and I realize that there is nothing I have gone thru that someone else hasn't. I always find myself in awe of the world that I live in and fall in love with it once again.

Little, nice things that don't take a lot of effort or money can make a guest's stay so much more enjoyable. I love to set guests up with everything they need so they can operate independently and not be left with tons of questions. I've used Airbnb a lot as a guest and I use those experiences to create an environment that people will enjoy and walk away thinking they got such a great deal for what they paid for. I love traveling and I want to go everywhere and see everything!""",100%,t,Portage Park,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,"Portage Park, Chicago, IL 60641, United States",Portage Park,41.95053816,-87.76093771,t,Private room,2,1,1,1,Real Bed,"{TV,Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air conditioning"",""Free parking on premises"",Gym,""Pets live on this property"",Cat(s),Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,Iron}",65,1300,,10,1,10,1125,3 weeks ago,30,60,90,365,10,10,10,f,strict,0.28,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0

You found one!), but also takes his watchdog duties seriously, so don't try to go upstairs if I'm not home (I keep the door locked, but just in case).

We are friendly people who enjoy meeting new friends and traveling. We have lived in the Caribbean, London, and New York before moving to Chicago. Came to Chicago primarily for school but then we loved it and decided to stay. Yes, we love Chicago, and even the winter is GREAT! Good food options are unbelievably amazing in Chicago.

Taneisha and I have multiple apartments on this website. Some of the apartments are  3 bedrooms, bathroom, living room, dining room, and kitchen. Some are two bedrooms, bathroom, living, and kitchen and the others are 1 bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and living room. We provide additional airbeds if needed. The airbeds are extremely comfortable and are queen size and 18 inches high. 

All the apartments have free WiFi, guestbooks, and basic amenities such as TV, iron, iron board, refrigerator, hair dryer, with water, pop, and juice, microwave, coffee maker, cups, plates, pots, pans, bathroom towels, shower items, etc.

Airbnb is extremely fun for us since we are also international.  We have traveled to most of the states in the US, London, Milan,  Italy, Turkey. I have also attended Universities on both sides of the Atlantic (London and Chicago). 

Favorite music are Reggae, R&B, hip hop, Latin music, country music. I love to eat and my favorite food are fish, fruits, and vegetables. My favorite sports are rock climbing, archery, diving, soccer, and basketball. 

These days if we are not out with friends, we are with family, or spending time on the computer.

There is a mini-fridge in the room, and a space in the main refrigerator for you. 

A cat lives in unit, and he rules the roost--14 yrs young! He's very friendly and sweet, but if you're allergic to pets, please be aware. I DO NOT allow other pets to join you, I apologize in advance. I also do not allow other guests without prior approval. The Landlord has a strict policy. 

I have some ground rules for my BNB home: BE courteous, BE friendly, BE honest, BE open. If you have ANY questions or concerns, feel free to ask any time. I am a very reasonable, down-to-earth person. I'm here to help you have a wonderful trip! 

I also have a NO DRUGS,  NO SMOKING policy, as my Landlord is a police officer, and is on premises.  The check-in times are case-by-case basis--I have somewhat normal hours and am home in the evenings, but the usual checkout time is 9am. Please message me with any questions. :)
